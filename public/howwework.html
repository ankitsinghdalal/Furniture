                    <h3>STEP 1</h3>
                    <em>WOOD & RAW MATERIAL STOCKING</em>
                    <p>
                        The basic raw material for manufacturing of furniture is wood. Wood obtained from the forest is of prime quality. Generally dry wood is recommended for manufacturing of quality wooden furniture. We preferably use the highest qualities of wood including Burma teak, oak and rosewood. For commercial and household furniture, as per our clients’ requests, we also use white-ash, commercial ply teak , and marandy wood. All our furniture undergoes anti-termite and anti-fire coating.

                    <h3>STEP 2</h3>
                    <em>SANDING & FINISHING</em>
                    <p>
                        Logs of wood are carefully cross cut into lengths required and then molded. These components are then carefully sanded to round all sharp edges and smoothen out all surfaces. Sanding refines and prepares the wood before it goes into the assembling process.

                    <h3>STEP 3</h3>
                    <em>MATERIALS ASSEMBLY</em>
                    <p>
                        Each components will be assembled accordingly to form the part of the intended furniture. Joints are glued together to form a strong bond. Assembled parts are then stacked together and labeled for traceability. Materials assembling is the relative long process and difficult.

                    <h3>STEP 4</h3>
                    <em>PAINTING & POLISHING</em>
                    <p>
                        It is a process of layering wood surface with purpose to make beautiful, robust and to protect furniture from insects or moisture in the air. Some type of furniture, finishing process easier be done before furniture be assembled. Assembled parts are dipped in teak oil and wiped dry to achieve the brown/teak finishing. Teak oil acts as repellent of wood destroying insects, fungicide, as well as providing some weather and UV resistance to the wood.

                    <em>UPHOLSTERY</em>
                    <p>
                        After the frame has been constructed the webbing and springs are installed and the burlap tacked in place. The process of fixing the edge rolls as well as the stuffing material are usually done by the same upholsters who install the webbing. The furniture is then padded to provide more comfort and protection to the user. The installation of the final covering is performed by a skillful technician. A specialist called a cutter does the planning of the layout of the various pieces of fabric for the covering.

                    <em>PACKING & SHIPPING</em>
                    <p>
                        Out of finishing, products move to packaging area. In this area some accessories (key, handle, reel, etc) and other equipment patched again. Kinds of packing also depend on last purpose and level quality furniture. More expensive and more far delivery location need stronger packaging and more carefully.
